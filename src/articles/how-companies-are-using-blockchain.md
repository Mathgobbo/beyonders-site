Over the past few years, we've seen a growing interest in blockchain technology and its use cases.  
In his famous article titled *Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System*, Satoshi Nakamotoâ€”almost as a response to the subprime crisisâ€”laid the groundwork for the first and most well-known digital currency in the world: **Bitcoin**. The initial interest in the technology stemmed from the idea of eliminating the need for intermediaries in monetary transactions. It was in 2009 that the Bitcoin blockchain was developed. Since then, many other blockchains and cryptocurrencies have emerged and enriched the ecosystem now known as **Web 3.0**.

For now, letâ€™s take a look at how companies and organizations are already benefiting from this technology and how your business can securely integrate blockchain into its processes.


### BEYOND CRYPTOS: Blockchain in the Corporate World

When we talk about blockchain, most people immediately think of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ether, or USDC. Of course, the ability to create digital currencies is an incredible feature made possible by blockchainâ€”but itâ€™s not the only one!

Today, there are several use cases that leverage blockchain technology. The creation of the Ethereum network by **Vitalik Buterin** in 2013 introduced the possibility of running softwareâ€”or rather, **applicationsâ€”on chain**. The concept of **dApps (decentralized applications)** came to life and began changing how we develop web software, marking the beginning of what we now call **Web 3.0**.

This shift in paradigm is still underway, and many remain cautious or skeptical. But thereâ€™s no need to fear. History shows us that humanity is always evolving, creating new technologies and ways of thinking. The **decentralization, immutability, transparency, and security** offered by blockchains are already proving valuable across sectorsâ€”with companies like **Walmart, Nike, Maersk, Starbucks, Mastercard, and Visa** actively exploring or implementing blockchain-based solutions.



### Blockchain in Supply Chain Management

It all began when the Vice President of Food Safety at Walmart requested the traceability of a batch of mangoes. Even with all data stored internally, the process took hours to complete. In response, Walmart partnered with IBM to store tracking data **on a blockchain**â€”and the same operation now takes just **2 seconds!**

This is a clear example of how blockchain technology can enhance supply chain management.  
Global supply chains often involve multiple corporations working in coordination. Knowing the origin of specific product batches is especially important in industries like food and health. With blockchain, itâ€™s possible to transparently store who purchased the product, when, where it came from, and other key data.

Blockchain ensures the **decentralization of supply chain data**, offering transparency and tamper-resistance.

In addition to Walmart, many other companies are adopting blockchain for logistics. For example, **The Home Depot** uses blockchain to **track products quickly, securely, and transparently** through a partnership with IBM.


### Digital Tokens â€“ NFTs as Digital Assets

The ability to create **unique and verifiable digital assets** is a growing revolution in the 21st-century business landscape. **Non-fungible tokens (NFTs)** go far beyond profile pictures and digital artâ€”theyâ€™re redefining how we manage identity, customer engagement, certifications, and digital ownership.

According to [Ethereumâ€™s official documentation](https://ethereum.org/en/nft/), NFTs can be used to:

- Prove attendance at events  
- Certify course completions  
- Represent digital in-game items  
- Authenticate digital artwork  
- Tokenize real-world assets (e.g., real estate, luxury goods)  
- Verify online identities  
- Grant gated access to exclusive content  
- Issue digital tickets  
- Represent decentralized domain names  
- Act as collateral in financial contracts

#### Brands using NFTs strategically:

**Nike â€“ .SWOOSH**  
In 2023, Nike launched **.SWOOSH**, a platform focused on NFTs representing digital sneakers, virtual clothing, and exclusive brand experiences. Users can **buy, collect, and even co-create** Nike digital products.

**NFL â€“ NFL All Day**  
The American football league created a platform where fans can **buy and sell iconic in-game moments as NFTs**, much like digital trading cards with real market value.

**McDonaldâ€™s, Ray-Ban, and Adidas**  
These global brands have released NFT collections as part of marketing campaigns, collectible product drops, and augmented reality experiencesâ€”blending **branding, exclusivity, and innovation**.


### International Payments

Cross-border payments still suffer from high fees, slow processing times, and frequent delays that can stall operations for days or even weeks.  Blockchain enables businesses to conduct financial transactions **without intermediaries**.

This is the exact problem **Bitcoin** set out to solve. A great example is **Visa**, a global leader in digital payments, which launched **Visa B2B Connect** in 2019. According to the [official website](https://www.visa.com.br/sobre-a-visa/noticias-visa/nova-sala-de-imprensa/b2b-conect.html):

> "Visa B2B Connect eliminates friction and accelerates international corporate transactions by enabling direct bank-to-bank transfers. The platformâ€™s unique digital identity feature tokenizes sensitive business informationâ€”such as banking details and account numbersâ€”into a unique identifier used for processing transactions. Visaâ€™s digital identity will transform how businesses exchange data for cross-border transactions."

By leveraging **on-chain payment solutions**, your company can save significant amounts in fees and timeâ€”while ensuring greater transparency and security. **The blockchain revolution in international financial operations is already here.**



### Identity Management

Large companies must securely store sensitive employee and project data, and control identity and access permissions to prevent leaks.  Traditionally, this is handled using relational databases and internal software. But blockchain can change this paradigm.

A **decentralized blockchain network** enables whatâ€™s known as **Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)**â€”where each employee or network participant **owns and manages their own data**.

This allows organizations to create **ultra-secure environments** with:

- Lower dependence on centralized servers  
- Elimination of single points of failure  
- Immutable and auditable data  
- Employee-controlled credentials

In such systems, employees hold their **verifiable credentials**, and access permissions can be validated using **smart contracts running on blockchain**.

#### Microsoftâ€™s example:  
The tech giant was a pioneer in developing **ION**, a decentralized identity network built on Bitcoin.  
Itâ€™s used to ensure **passwordless authentication and verifiable identities**â€”applied both to internal processes and third-party integrations.


### Conclusion

**Blockchain technology is in full swing.** We're witnessing a real revolution in how we build softwareâ€”and this is only the beginning. Itâ€™s worth noting that blockchains are not here to **replace** every legacy system, but to **complement them**. The fusion of traditional systems and blockchain offers a path toward a **more secure, transparent, and efficient digital world**.
