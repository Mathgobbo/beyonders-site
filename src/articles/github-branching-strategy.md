## Git Branching Strategies - Github Flow

When you use git, you are free to create as many branches as you wish, and discover the strategy that most suits your needs. But let's talk the truth, we usually end up following a pattern/strategy as it probably already was tested and approved by many other developers, projects and companies. So in this post we will comment about a few strategies and dive deeper in the GitHub Flow branching strategy!

### (5) Common Strategies

I don't like to waste time, so let's go over 5 common strategies to manage your branches, releases and features.

**1. Feature Branching**
The process involves creating a dedicated branch for each new feature or bug fix, allowing developers to work in isolation without affecting the stability of the main codebase. Once the development on a branch is complete, it undergoes thorough testing and peer review before being merged into the main branch—typically the "main" or "develop" branch. This approach ensures that only fully-reviewed code is integrated into the core project, minimizing the risk of introducing errors.

This branching strategy is ideal for teams that prioritize strict code reviews, enforce quality standards, and work on features or bug fixes independently.

**2. Gitflow**
This branching model establishes a disciplined workflow for managing releases by introducing distinct branch types such as develop, release, hotfix, and feature branches to streamline the development process. It helps organize work efficiently, ensuring each branch has a specific role in the software lifecycle.

It is particularly well-suited for large projects that follow scheduled release cycles, where managing complexity and maintaining stability are crucial.

**3. Gitlab Flow**
This strategy merges concepts from Feature Branching and Gitflow while streamlining the workflow to increase the simplicity. It places a strong emphasis on deployment and seamlessly integrates with issue tracking and continuous deployment practices. The approach includes a main branch that always reflects production-ready code and allows for optional branches for different environments (such as staging or production).

It is particularly suitable for teams leveraging GitLab’s integrated tools and aiming to fully embrace continuous deployment (CD) practices, making it easier to automate and manage releases efficiently.
