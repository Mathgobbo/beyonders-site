            "Good question! For starters, the annual cost of a full-time senior-level designer now exceeds $80.000, plus benefits (and good luck finding one available). Aside from that, you may not always have enough work to keep them busy at all times, so you're stuck paying for time you aren't able to utilize.",

            "Well, because hiring a service like ours offers much more advantages than these DIY website builders. We provide fully customized websites that reflect your unique brand identity, allowing you to stand out in the market. Our expertise ensures scalability, optimized performance, and tailored functionalities that align with your specific business needs. With dedicated technical support and ongoing maintenance, you will also have a long-term partnership focused on your success.
